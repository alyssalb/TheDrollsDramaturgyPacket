      <h2>Dramaturg's Note</h2>
      <p>Hello cast and crew of <i>The Drolls</i> at UCF Pegasus PlayLab 2025! This packet provides historical, contextual, and thematic grounding for our process. Drolls represent a vibrant and subversive form of theatre, proving our survival instinct and power as artists to persevere even under such conditions as the Puritan rule in 17th Century England, which shut down almost all artistic [re]production in the UK for a time.</p>
      <p>The hope is for these materials to help frame and deepen our understanding of the world that these characters, several based on real people, inhabited so that we might more richly present that world on stage. This context should aid us in bringing that humour, defiance, tenacity, and persistence characteristic of the time, place, and people in the play to life in our staged workshop production.</p>
      <p>This document is a starting place -- take what is useful and leave what is not. And above all, please contact me or catch me during/after rehearsal if you have questions or thoughts at any time during this process. I am happy to talk through things and do further research as we proceed through the production process. Contact me at any time at alyssa.barrack@ucf.edu.</p>

      <h2>Introduction to Drolls</h2>
        <h1>Drollery Cliff Notes</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Often Extracted from well-known farces, folk tales, and plays (Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher).</li>
          <li>Emphasized physical comedy, quick pacing, and familiar character archetypes -- easy to follow and packed with low brow humor.</li>
          <li>Reworked into 10-15 minute bits to be performed at inns and taverns or on the street.</li>
          <li>Music, dancing, clowning, and political satire were all common features of drolls.</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>Features and Key Figures</h1>
      <p><b>Definition:</b> Short, comic, often subversive theatrical sketches first performed in the Interregnum or Commonwealth period of England under Puritan rule.</p>
      <p><b>Function:</b> To circumvent censorship, maintain audience appetite for drama, use skills to earn potential wage in a time of extreme depression. Artists endeavor to make art, regardless of circumstance or cost.</p>
      <p><b>Origins:</b> Created during theatre closures from 1642-1660 in England, lining up with the start of the English Civil War. Often adaptations of familiar folk tales and farces, and usually played up to be extremely bawdy and crude in nature.
      <ul>
        <li>Some were adapted from more serious work, such as Shakespeare. In that case they generally adapted comedic bits, such as the clowns like Falstaff and the Rude Mechanicals.</li>
        <li>Not many people would have strongly remembered Shakespeare and his contemporaries on the stage, though they would be familiar with the arts as an important part of society. Shakespeare died circa 1616, and shortly after Puritan rule most theaters were destroyed (the Red Bull in Clerkenwell appears to have been maintained and ignored/repurposed).</li>
        <li>Non-artists are unlikely to seek out art in a time of its strict and punishable ban.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Cox: Actor and comic droll adaptor; the most famous droll performer, and apparently the only one we have any information on at all.</p>
      <p>Francis Kirkman: Bookseller and publisher of <i>The Wits, or Sport Upon Sport</i> (1662). This is the most comprehensive and contemporary (to the form) compliation of Drolleries we still have, produced just after theaters reopened and the ban on creativity was lifted.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes and Guiding Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Resistance Through Humor:</b> How do drolls use comedy to critique authority></li>
        <li><b>Theatre as Survival:</b> What risks did performers take to keep performing? What risks might have existed if they hadn't kept performing?</li>
        <li><b>Adaptation and Compression:</b> How do these works differ structurally and in impact from full-length plays? What might this say about methods of adaptation to new formats?</li>
        <li><b>Audience and Space:</b> How did the absence of formal, purpose-built theaters shape performance style? How might audience have differed in this environment versus the sanctioned special-spaces of theaters before the closures?</li>
        <li><b>Reflection Prompts:</b> How would you adapt a scene from your favorite play or movie into a 5-10 minute street/found space sketch a-la Drolls? Have you every done geurrilla or found-space theater? Improv? What does that feel like as a performer versus structured plays and performances?</li>
