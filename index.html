      <h2>Dramaturg's Note</h2>
      <h3>Hello cast and crew of <i>The Drolls</i> at UCF Pegasus PlayLab 2025! This packet provides historical, contextual, and thematic grounding for our process. Drolls represent a vibrant and subversive form of theatre, proving our survival instinct and power as artists to persevere even under such conditions as the Puritan rule in 17th Century England, which shut down almost all artistic [re]production in the UK for a time.</h3>
      <h3>The hope is for these materials to help frame and deepen our understanding of the world that these characters, several based on real people, inhabited so that we might more richly present that world on stage. This context should aid us in bringing that humour, defiance, tenacity, and persistence characteristic of the time, place, and people in the play to life in our staged workshop production.</h3>
      <h3>This document is a starting place -- take what is useful and leave what is not. And above all, please contact me or catch me during/after rehearsal if you have questions or thoughts at any time during this process. I am happy to talk through things and do further research as we proceed through the production process. Contact me at any time at alyssa.barrack@ucf.edu.</h3>

      <h2>Introduction to Drolls</h2>
        <h1>Drollery Cliff Notes</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Often Extracted from well-known farces, folk tales, and plays (Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher).</li>
          <li>Emphasized physical comedy, quick pacing, and familiar character archetypes -- easy to follow and packed with low brow humor.</li>
          <li>Reworked into 10-15 minute bits to be performed at inns and taverns or on the street.</li>
          <li>Music, dancing, clowning, and political satire were all common features of drolls.</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>Features and Key Figures</h1>
      <p><b>Definition:</b> Short, comic, often subversive theatrical sketches first performed in the Interregnum or Commonwealth period of England under Puritan rule.</p>
      <p><b>Function:</b> To circumvent censorship, maintain audience appetite for drama, use skills to earn potential wage in a time of extreme depression. Artists endeavor to make art, regardless of circumstance or cost.</p>
      <p><b>Origins:</b> Created during theatre closures from 1642-1660 in England, lining up with the start of the English Civil War. Often adaptations of familiar folk tales and farces, and usually played up to be extremely bawdy and crude in nature.
      <ul>
        <li>Some were adapted from more serious work, such as Shakespeare. In that case they generally adapted comedic bits, such as the clowns like Falstaff and the Rude Mechanicals.</li>
        <li>Not many people would have strongly remembered Shakespeare and his contemporaries on the stage, though they would be familiar with the arts as an important part of society. Shakespeare died circa 1616, and shortly after Puritan rule most theaters were destroyed (the Red Bull in Clerkenwell appears to have been maintained and ignored/repurposed).</li>
        <li>Non-artists are unlikely to seek out art in a time of its strict and punishable ban.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Cox: Actor and comic droll adaptor; the most famous droll performer, and apparently the only one we have any information on at all.</p>
      <p>Francis Kirkman: Bookseller and publisher of <i>The Wits, or Sport Upon Sport</i> (1662). This is the most comprehensive and contemporary (to the form) compliation of Drolleries we still have, produced just after theaters reopened and the ban on creativity was lifted.</p>

      <h2>Shakespeare's Plays in <i>The Drolls</i></h2>
      <h1><i>Hamlet</i></h1>
        <p><i>Hamlet</i> is one of Shakespeare's most famous and most performed plays, a tragedy about the Prince of Denmark whose father is killed by his uncle, who then marries his mother. Hamlet struggles ith his unsurety and inability to take action for most of the play, and it often acts as an introspection on the complex behavior of humans in complicated situations.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Pp. 19 "I have heard the cock, that is the trumpet of the morn..."; spoken by Horatio, coming out of the night when he saw King Hamlet's ghost and recognizing with relief the morning.</li>
           <li>Pp. 42 "To Be or Not to Be"; from probably the most famous Shakespearean soliloquy. Here, Hamlet debates his options - to kill himself and not have to agonize over his choices in a complicated and dire situation, or to live for fear of the unknown after death.</li>
           <li>Pp. 45 "But look, the morn in russet mantle clad..."; another Horatio line about welcoming the morning after a fearful night.</li>
           <li>Pp. 50 "There is nothing good nor bad but thinking makes it so"; Hamlet.</li>
           <li>Pp. 58 "Death, the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns"; Hamlet, the soliloquy.</li>
           <li>Pp. 59 Mocking Cowly with the to be or not to be speech.</li>
           <li>Pp. 60 "Speak to me no more!"; Queen Gertrude doesn't want to hear about her husband's villainy.</li>
           <li>Pp. 81 "Is they noble mind overthrown"; a paraphrase of an Ophelia line.</li>
           <li>Pp. 81 "Pangs of despised love"; one of the hardships that Hamlet contemplates in his big soliloquy.</li>
         </ul>
      <h1><i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i></h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 81 "Angel awoke me from my flowery bed"; Titania, queen of the fairies, awoken by Bottom.</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 <a href="https://youtu.be/zPv9ICpMyRw?si=vz_xjPDomsjaEScS">The Rude Mechanicals</a> perform Pyramus and Thisbe; the play performed by the amateur acting troup at the end of Midsummer. </li>
        </ul>
      <h1><i>Richard II</i></h1>
        <p><i>Richard II</i> is one of Shakespeare's histories, centered on the actions and scenarios that led to the overthrow and murder of King Richard II of England.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 58 "Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs"; Richard II grapples with his mortality and the inevitability of his death in the upcoming fight for his throne.</li>
          <li>Pp. 71 "This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle..."; a prophecy about Richard's downfall.</li>
        </ul>
      <h1><i>Romeo and Juliet</i></h1>
        <p>A tragedy about two teenagers in ill-fated love.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 30 "Oh speak again bright angel"; from the Balcony scene, Juliet is angelic to Romeoo and often portrayed to be physically over him in the balcony, literalizing this metaphor.</li>
          <li>Pp. 30 "It is  my lady, o, it is my love" and "she speaks, yet she says nothing" and so on; same scene, Romeo is overwhelmed with infatuation.</li>
          <li>Pp. 81 "Sinking under love's heavy burden"; paraphrase Romeo</li>
          <li>Pp. 81 "He is as glorious to this night"; paraphrase Romeo</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 "Is there not pity sitting in the clouds"; quote from Juliet</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks"</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>Sonnets</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 23 "She is more beautiful than a summer's day"; alludes to <i>Sonnet 18</i>, "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?", a poem in which the narrator immortalizes their lover by recording their beauty in a poem -- so long as the poem lives, so too does the beauty of the person is captures.</li>        
          <li>Pp. 29 referencees this same sonnet.</li>
          <li>Pp. 82 references this same sonnet.</li>
        </ul>
      <h1><i>The Taming of the Shrew</i></h1>
        <p>This play centeres around a "shrewish" or independent, witty, and outspoken woman, who is "tamed" by a man into marriage through manipulation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 29 "Do not offer war when you should kneel for peace"; this is from the final speech of Katherine (the "shrew) to Petruchio (the man who "tamed" her), and reflects her new perspective on how women should behave. Whether this is intended by Katherine as earnest or ironic can be debated, but either way it shows the manipulation she has undergone and the situation she finds herselve in at the end of the play. Whether she believes it or not, it is how she has to behave.</li>
        </ul>
      <h1><i>The Tempest</i></h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 81 "The very instant that you saw him"; paraphrase.</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 "Hell is empty, and all the devils are here".</li>
          <li>Pp. 96 "Oh brave new world, that hath such people in it".</li>
        </ul>
      <h1><i>Macbeth</i></h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 60 "Oh horror, horror, horror"; spoken by Macduff upon finding Duncan's body.</li>
        </ul>
      <h1><i>As You Like It</i></h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 61 "I beseech you, punish me not".</li>
          <li>Pp. 96 "The lusty horn is not a thing to laugh or scorn".</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>Misc.</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Pp. 60 "I was tricked"; this line appears in several plays and various contexts, as a common phrase.</li>
          <li>Pp. 81 "Art thou wandering in an unknown field"; paraphrase, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>.</li>
          <li>Pp. 82 "And yet he is not"; <i>Henry VI, Part I</i>.</li>
          <li>Pp. 83 "Oh let me not be mad"; <i>King Lear</i>.</li>
          <li>Pp. 99 "There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain"; <i>Twelfth Night</i>.</li>
        </ul>

The Drolls were extremely bawdy and crass acts put on spur of the moment by small troupes of actors with little to no set or costumes and very minimal props. Acts were short, often abridged or adapted from previous existing material, folk tales and pastorals, or improvised on the spot by actors.</div>

            Interregnum and Puritan England
          </div>
          <div class="definition">The period of Puritan rule under leader Oliver Cromwell after the beheading of King Charles I and before his son's assendency to the throne. During and after the English Civil War. The Puritans banned most forms of merriment and entertainment, including theatre, gambling, Christmas and Easter celebrations, dancing and singing in public, rhyming in public, etc. They did allow things like the opera, likely due to Cromwell's personal tastes. The period of theatrical reopenings after this time moved us towards the modern model of smaller indoor theatres and single-purpose private theatrical venues, and away from a long history of outdoor, publicly acessible theatre.</div>

This was a real form of punishemnt, often against women who were too loud, outspoken, or employed in sex work (and caught by the law). A custom "cucking" or "ducking" stool allowed the criminal's body to be strapped on, and then swiveled over the water of the Thames and dunked multiple times. A powerful form of public shaming, potentially dangerous, and usually heavily attended by a crowd of jeering spectators (as most punishments and executions were at the time).</div>

John and Jane Davenant, parents of William, took ownership over the tavern around 1600 and earned a coveted wine license within the city. Shakespeare lived in or frequented the location, and is rumored to be the real father of William. Shakespeare's documents, left lying around the Tavern, contribute importantly to our contemporary knowledge of him -- That is, that we know of him at all is often attributed to the papers kept by William Davenant from the Crown and used in the theatres during the Restoration.</div>

            Drag in 17th Century London
          </div>
          <div class="definition">Drag was not uncommon in this time, both on the stages and on the streets (though often punished in the latter case). It was considered with suspicion, but allowed onstage prior to the Interregnum. Some evidence suggests that cross-dressing in regular life/on the streets may have been a more dominant behavior of women, for a variety of purposees mostly related to increased perception of personal freedom to navigate society. This came at a cost.</div>

        <li><b>Theatre as Survival:</b> What risks did performers take to keep performing? What risks might have existed if they hadn't kept performing?</li>
        <li><b>Adaptation and Compression:</b> How do these works differ structurally and in impact from full-length plays? What might this say about methods of adaptation to new formats?</li>
        <li><b>Audience and Space:</b> How did the absence of formal, purpose-built theaters shape performance style? How might audience have differed in this environment versus the sanctioned special-spaces of theaters before the closures?</li>
        <li><b>Reflection Prompts:</b> How would you adapt a scene from your favorite play or movie into a 5-10 minute street/found space sketch a-la Drolls? Have you every done geurrilla or found-space theater? Improv? What does that feel like as a performer versus structured plays and performances?</li>
